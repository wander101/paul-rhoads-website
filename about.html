    <div class="about-text">
      <p>Paul Rhoads was born in Mexico in 1956. He grew up in New York and, at 18, attended The New York Studio School for several months followed by stints at The Boston Museum School, The Art Student's League and The New York School of Visual Arts. At these places he studied with Mercedes Matter, Andrew Forge, Esteban Vicente, Clarence Washington, Will Barnet and Herbert Katzman. Of special significance were the 10 years subsequently spent with Aaron Kurzen, with whom he had studied at Dalton highschool (1971-74).</p>

      <p>Aaron Kurzen, part of the Han Hofmann circle, was a surrealist painter and sculptor, and disciple of Marcel Duchamp. Paul Rhoads' artistic direction is greatly influenced by his father, George Rhoads, a surrealist like Kurzen, who has worked in many styles including, in the 1960s, the expressionist cityscapes which were given several shows at the Dintenfass gallery. Other crucial early influences were Herbert Katzman, Robert d'Arista and Gandy Brodie.</p>

      <p>Paul Rhoads has lived in France since 1990. He was married to painter Genevieve Bonnet-Walter.</p>
